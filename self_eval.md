# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
It is useful to use a conditional in your code when you are trying to determine if something is true or false, and to then execute a certain block of code depending on whether the condition was met or not.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I don't think I would do anything differently. I enjoyed the assignment and was able to use some problem solving in the process, which made for some good practice.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
What brought me the most satisfaction was not only getting the code to work, but also using my problem solving skills to easily find an answer on google to help my write more simplified code.
